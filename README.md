# CMPSC 600 Research Journal

This Quarto site constitutes your [`Research Journal`](https://github.com/allegheny-college-comp-fall-2024/course-materials?tab=readme-ov-file#research-journal). From the course syllabus and contract:

> ## Class activities posts
> Your research journal is a public account of your research process. Each week, you will be given a prompt
> and a related activity (see below for details on activities). For each week of the semester, you must write a
> post of at least 250 words which responds to the prompt and includes elements of the related activity.
>
> Students must complete these posts within 1 week; posts are assigned on Fridays during class sessions and must be completed by the start of the following Friday's session. They will be used as part of a class check-in activity at the beginning of each Friday session.
>
> ## Research meeting posts
> Students must also add posts to their research journal after all meetings with any readers. These posts should
> contain a 100-word reflection on/summary of research progress and a Markdown list of tasks discussed using Markdown
> checkboxes to indicate tasks completed. These posts may feature tasks that recur from week to week until finished or
> short-duration tasks assigned by readers that can be completed in a matter of days.
>
> Given that these meetings should occur weekly, readers should expect at least 14 posts for a student's 600 semester and 14 posts for a 610 work.

Eventually, this site (and `README`) will contain build for your working thesis document. Quarto, serving as a build system for
your site will build your thesis document as a website and a PDF. For now, it is your responisbility to main this space as your
[`Research Journal`](https://github.com/allegheny-college-comp-fall-2024/course-materials?tab=readme-ov-file#research-journal).
