# CMPSC 600 Research Journal

This Quarto site constitutes your [`Research Journal`](https://github.com/allegheny-college-comp-fall-2024/course-materials?tab=readme-ov-file#research-journal). From the course syllabus and contract:

> ## Class activities posts
> Your research journal is a public account of your research process. Each week, you will be given a prompt
> and a related activity (see below for details on activities). For each week of the semester, you must write a
> post of at least 250 words which responds to the prompt and includes elements of the related activity.
>
> Students must complete these posts within 1 week; posts are assigned on Fridays during class sessions and must be completed by the start of the following Friday's session. They will be used as part of a class check-in activity at the beginning of each Friday session.
>
> ## Research meeting posts
> Students must also add posts to their research journal after all meetings with any readers. These posts should
> contain a 100-word reflection on/summary of research progress and a Markdown list of tasks discussed using Markdown
> checkboxes to indicate tasks completed. These posts may feature tasks that recur from week to week until finished or
> short-duration tasks assigned by readers that can be completed in a matter of days.
>
> Given that these meetings should occur weekly, readers should expect at least 14 posts for a student's 600 semester and 14 posts for a 610 work.

Eventually, this site (and `README`) will contain build for your working thesis document. Quarto, serving as a build system for
your site will build your thesis document as a website and a PDF. For now, it is your responisbility to main this space as your
[`Research Journal`](https://github.com/allegheny-college-comp-fall-2024/course-materials?tab=readme-ov-file#research-journal).

## Enabling site build

This site deploys via Github Pages using the Quarto static site building system.

1. Go to the `Settings` menu on this repository and locate the `Pages` submenu.

![GitHub Settings, Pages submenu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReadyResearchersTemplates/site-template/media/img/600%20-%20Site%20Template%20-%20Github%20Pages%20Menu.png)

2. On the resulting screen, find the `Build and deployment` menu; select `GitHub Actions`

### `Private` vs. `Public` availablity

You retain the choice to make this journal private or public. The `Pages` settings menu allows either. Your URL will change
depending on which selection you make, and you should be able to find the resulting URL of your journal by visiting the pages
section of the repository's `Settings` menu. Your URL should display at the top of the page:

## Thesis writing

Per the course syllabus:

> ##### Thesis writing
>
> All researchers must also document their work in the form of a written thesis. While variations on the typical structure and
> contents of a thesis can be specific to a certain project, a typical CIS department thesis contains `5` sections:
>
> 1. Introduction
> 2. Related Work
> 3. Methods
> 4. Experiments
> 5. Future Work
>
>During the `600` semester course, students will complete sections `1` and `2` for review by their reader(s). Thesis writing
>templates and materials will be distributed later in the semester after Demo Day.

This repository also now contains all materials you'll need to build your Senior Thesis. Requirements and guidelines for
evaluation are written in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
