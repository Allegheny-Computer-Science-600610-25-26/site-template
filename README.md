For more information about the course requirements for your 600-level course in
Computer and Information Science, please refer to the syllabus for your course.
To enable you to complete many of the deliverables for the 600-level course,
this repository contain contains instructions for your research journal and your
senior thesis document. Quarto, serving as a build system for your site, will
build your thesis document as a website and a PDF. Your research journal
contains short blog posts in one of the following categories: `reflection`,
`feedback`, `agenda`, and `changelogs`.

## Enabling site build

This site deploys via Github Pages using the Quarto static site building system.

1. Go to the `Settings` menu on this repository and locate the `Pages` submenu.

![GitHub Settings, Pages submenu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReadyResearchersTemplates/site-template/media/img/600%20-%20Site%20Template%20-%20Github%20Pages%20Menu.png)

2. On the resulting screen, find the `Build and deployment` menu; select `GitHub Actions`

### `Private` vs. `Public` availability

You retain the choice to make this journal private or public. The `Pages`
settings menu allows either. Your URL will change depending on which selection
you make, and you should be able to find the resulting URL of your journal by
visiting the pages section of the repository's `Settings` menu. Your URL should
display at the top of the page:

## Thesis writing

Per the course syllabus:

> ##### Thesis writing
>
> All researchers must also document their work in the form of a written thesis. While variations on the typical structure and
> contents of a thesis can be specific to a certain project, a typical CIS department thesis contains `5` sections:
>
> 1. Introduction
> 2. Related Work
> 3. Methods
> 4. Experiments
> 5. Future Work
>
>During the `600` semester course, students will complete sections `1` and `2` for review by their reader(s). Thesis writing
>templates and materials will be distributed later in the semester after Demo Day.

This repository now also contains all materials you'll need to build your Senior Thesis. Requirements and guidelines for
evaluation are written in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
