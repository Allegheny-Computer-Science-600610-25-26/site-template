# 600/610: Senior Thesis Starter for Allegheny College CIS

## Introduction

This repository contains the starter for the Senior Thesis document. This
document compiles using GitHub Actions.  The template contains more specific
details about its use. The remainder of this `CONTRIBUTING` file overview the
project's requirements and the process of publishing the research journal and
releasing a thesis document via GitHub Actions. Please see the course syllabus
for more details about the course or the assessment requirements.

## Overview

This assignment requires a researcher to write a Markdown and LaTeX document,
stored in the file `thesis/index.md` and one of the "underscore files" for the
senior thesis chapters (e.g., `thesis/_introduction.md` or
`thesis/_related_work.md`) that describes the key aspects of a senior thesis
research project. Please refer to the source code in these files for an
explanation of the components of a senior thesis and the way in which you create
them in Markdown and/or LaTeX.

Your course instructor will reduce a researcher's grade for this assignment if
the PDF of your completed thesis document has not been properly released before
the assignment's due date as specified in the GitHub Classroom page when you
accept this assignment. Unless you provide the course instructors with
documentation of the extenuating circumstances that you are facing, no late work
will be considered towards your grade for this project.

## Requirements

For specific details about the general evaluation rubric for _minimum
requirements_ please refer to the course syllabus. Please note that your senior
thesis chapters in your time in `600` will be evaluated according to the content
that you submit in that course and your senior thesis chapters submitted during
`610` will be evaluated according to all of the baseline requirements. This
means that a student's work for `600` will not be evaluated according to
requirements that they could not yet fulfill until the completion of their
senior thesis. For instance, the requirement that "The thesis consists of at
least `15000` words" applies to a student's work in `610` and _not_ `600`.
Finally, please note that these are only baseline requirements and it is
expected that an exceptional senior thesis will exceed these requirements.

Please consult the following sub-sections, as section requirements may have
changed from requirements in previous years. All descriptions of each section
are delimited by the understanding that sections should "include, but not be
limited to" the areas highlighted. It is also important to note that students
may, with the consent of their both their first and second readers, modify the
structure of their senior thesis so that it includes, for instance, different
chapters or different ordering of chapters. With that said, the final senior
thesis that a student submits must still meet all the baseline requirements
outlined in the course syllabus.

Also keep in mind that the typical instruction to "whenever possible, use and
describe one or more concrete examples and technical diagrams" applies across
_all_ relevant chapters listed below.

A final note about requirements: nearly all chapters request some discussion of
ethical implications inherent in projects. The ways in which ethical issues
impact research will vary from project to project. Your first and second readers
will be able to guide you on a project-by-project basis toward responding to the
ethics requirements listed below.

### Highlights of Thesis Requirements

The following lists of requirements describe the general _shape_, and some of
the fundamental specifics of what each chapter entails. Meeting the following
requirements ensures a _passing_ grade, and not necessarily anything above that
watermark. Please review the course syllabus for more details about the specific
baseline requirements for each chapter. The purpose of the content in these
lists it to use "action words" to highlight the key "tasks" that each chapter
should accomplish as a part of the entire senior thesis document.

#### Introduction Section Requirements

* **States** the problem addressed in this research
* **Overviews** the project's aims and objectives
* **Summarizes** the background motivating your research
* **Highlights** the key contributions of the project
* **Highlights** the ethical issues implied by the current state of the problem
underlying the work

#### Related Work Requirements

* **Reviews** the relevant existing work (i.e., the "literature review")
* **Furnishes** a concise, scholarly review of the literature explaining the
background to the proposed research
* **Provides** the context for the aims of the research in relation to existing
work on the topic
* **Places** the senior thesis research in the context of the relevant existing
work
* **Connects** to the ethical discussions referenced in the `Introduction`

#### Method Section Requirements

* **Describes** the infrastructure and tools implemented to serve, test, and
support research and conduct experiments
* **Enumerates** the general processes and code used by the project with
required technical content that would include, for instance, diagrams and/or
code snippets and/or algorithm statements
* **Addresses** the interventions that the research incorporates or develops to
address ethical concerns in datasets, software processes, or theoretical
approaches

#### Experimental Results Requirements

* **Displays and discusses** evaluative metrics and data used as validation
strategies the projects
* **Defines** the thresholds for success, and discusses the outcomes of
experiments relative to them
* **Explores** the trade-offs evident in the experimental results, leverages
previously defined metrics about, for instance, efficiency and/or effectiveness
* **Uses** techniques such as statistics and/or data visualizations to highlight
the key trends in the experimental results
* **Discusses** any threats to validity that remain from the original summary of
the research or those introduced by any approaches or data used in the these
research and implementation process

#### Conclusion and Future Work Requirements

- **Summarizes** your research and experimental outcomes proposes
- **Proposes**, where applicable, future areas of work or research indicated by
the conclusion of this research
- **Furnishes** an evidence- or results-based appraisal of ethical issues left
unresolved or created by this research

## Gauging Your Level of Achievement

With a task such as this, defining _precisely_ what constitutes exceptional or
above-average work is difficult, as each project is distinct and is only
comparable to its own potential. Bearing in mind that the title of this
subsection uses the word "Gauging", the following lists can help you to see what
your achievement may look like any of the following scenarios.

### Exceptional work (i.e., A- and upward)

Exceptional projects share the following features:

* the thesis is _exhaustive_, often approaching double the required word count
(`20,000`-`30,000` words, minimum)
* the thesis displays a clear grasp of the relevant literature (engaging `30`+
sources of high disciplinary quality)
* discussion of ethical and technical imperatives occur throughout the sections,
often reinforcing or relating to prior topics of discussion in the introduction
and/or related work
* the project discusses, coordinates, and relates sources to each other in both
complementary and contradictory ways, often highlighting or at least attempting
to resolve conflicts where they arise
* the methodology behind the project is clear, often using multiple diagrams to
discuss structure and relationships of the various parts of the related artifact
* experiments show sound methods that, even if generating unsupportive data, are
discussed with critical reflection and clear demonstration of opportunities,
faults, and/or successes with reference to how this changed/changes the project
as a whole
* future work clearly grapples with the tasks left undone and the project's
impact on the larger computational communities in which it participates

### Above average work (B- to B+)

Above average projects may be described as:

* _substantial_, approaching higher word counts (`20,000` words)
* displaying a grasp of much, but not all, relevant literature (engaging `25`+
sources of moderate disciplinary quality or authority)
* discussion of ethical and technical imperatives occur in more than one or two
sections, but may remain unresolved or unaddressed
* the project discusses, coordinates, and relates sources to each other without
necessarily recognizing conflicts or areas of contradiction
* the methodology behind the project is clear, though there remain some
questions about project operations, security, or design
* experiments demonstrate effort in developing results, though the conversation
around them does not provide reflective inquiry into faults or successes and
their causes/effects
* future work names and discusses tasks remaining undone and the ethical issues
raised by the research, but does not suggest how these relate to the larger
communities in which the project traffics

### Average work (C- to C+)

Average projects often fulfill the requirements above, but stop at having
completed the technical distinctions the project asks for in its specifications.

### Below-average work (D to D+)

Below-average projects miss key requirements and are often under word count,
feature fewer sources than are required and otherwise do not fulfill a
reasonable portion of the tasks defined. Sources are low-quality and often look
more like tutorials than higher-level disciplinary discussion. Projects falling
into this category fulfill 60% - 75% of the requirements.

### Failing work (F)

Failing projects lack entire chapters or provide very minimal attempts to
complete them. Sources are low-quality and/or are missing. Multiple requirements
(on the order of 50% or more) are not fulfilled. Writing is cursory and not
descriptive; may include many instances of generalization and no evidence.
