# Method of approach

This chapter answers the "how" question - how did you complete your project,
including the overall design of your study, details of the algorithms and tools you
have used, etc.  Use technical diagrams, equations, algorithms, and paragraphs of text
to describe the research that you have completed. Be sure to number all figures and
tables and to explicitly refer to them in your text.

This should contain:

* lists
* with points
* and more points
  * possibly subpoints

For those projects whose implications address social or moral issues (i.e. ethical
standards, causes, effects), you will want to use this section to describe how you
actively mitigated or considered these issues.
