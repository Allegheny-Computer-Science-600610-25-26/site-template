# Introduction

This chapter describes your completed senior thesis work,
including the overall aims  and the background motivating your research. Whenever
possible, you should use one or more concrete examples and technical diagrams.

It is often useful and necessary to separate the introduction into multiple sections.
Several possible sections are proposed below, you can use these or distribute your
introductory text into sections in another way.

The headings below propose _one way_ you might structure this section of the document.

## Motivation

## Current State of the Art

## Goals of the Project

## Ethical Implications

This document requires that you discuss the ethical implications of your work -- no
matter how benign you consider the outcome of your project. As several major studies
of ethical issues in computer science assert: _no project is completely value-neutral_.

To assist you in elaborating on these issues, the following areas are topics you might
consider addressing. You do not need to address all of them.

* Information Privacy
* Information Accuracy (e.g. can contain reliability)
* Potential Misuse (e.g. computer crime, unintended consequences)
* Second- or Third-Party Risk (e.g. safety)
* Data Collection Issues (e.g. issues inherent in collecting data)
* Algorithmic or Data Bias
* Potential Power Difference / Social Imbalance / Issues in Equity

In addition, reflect on ways that the above harms can be or are mitigated by your work.
