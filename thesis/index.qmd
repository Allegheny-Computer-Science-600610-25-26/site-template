# Template description

This repository contains the starter materials for your thesis in Computer
Science 600 and 610. The main directory of this repository contains the Markdown
template for a project designed for use with GitHub Classroom. To learn more about
the course in which these assignments were completed, please refer to the `README.md` file.

The template specifies various settings in the `_metadata.yml` file included in the
repository. Change the appropriate values under the `Project-specific values`
heading. Changing other values outside of that section may cause the project to
fail to build. **Modify these values at your own risk.**

Author your thesis in the `index.md` document using appropriate Markdown
hierarchy and syntax; GitHub Actions will automatically create a PDF from the relevant
files.. Consult the `README` of the proposal repository to learn how to properly build
and release this PDFs.

## Citations and references

Including references throughout requires a specific pseudo-Markdown tag, demonstrated
in the following blockquote. (Inspect the `thesis.md` file to see the format.)

> A citation, when included correctly, will appear as it does at the end of this
> sentence. [@plaat1996research]

## Labeling figures

To label a figure (i.e. an image), referencing the image using correct Markdown
will automatically caption the figure:

```markdown
![Label](images/IMAGE_NAME.png)
```

## Labeling tables

To provide a label for a table, write a short caption for the table and prefix the caption
with `Table:` as in the example below:

```
Table: A two-row table demonstrating tables

|Row number | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
|1          |Row 1        |
|2          |Row 2        |
```

## Other template information

Two things specific to this template to also keep in mind:

1. It is your responsibility to remove this description section before building
the PDF version you plan to defend.
2. References _will only appear if cited correctly_ in the text

## Note on `LaTeX` commands

Documents may include specific `LaTeX` commands _in Markdown_. To render these, surround the commands
with markup denoting `LaTeX`. For example:

```
Checkmark character:   $\checkmark$
Superscript character: $^{\dag}$
```

If using a special package not included in the template, add the desired `LaTeX`
package or command/macro to the `header-includes` property in [config.yaml](config.yaml).

Should this package not be included in the environment shipped with this template,
you may also need to add the package to the [GitHub Actions Workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml).

Direct any questions about issues to your first reader.
